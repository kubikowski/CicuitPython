Designed for use with an Adafruit CircuitPython compatible board, specifically those with the classical 'Uno' type architecture. To learn about CircuitPython setup visit https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/. 

When replacing files on a circuit python device, be sure to first delete the original files before adding the changed files to the board.
This ensures the modues add correctly and can be referenced by each other without casung AttributeErrors.
